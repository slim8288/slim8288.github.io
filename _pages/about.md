Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford University. I work in the lab of Dr. Kevin Arrigo. My research focuses on primary producers and how the polar oceans are responding to climate change. I like to say that I study "where, when, how, and why algae bloom" using a combination of satellite remote sensing, models, and field observations. Some specific areas of interest include sea ice biogeochemistry, algal sinking speeds and carbon export, and the appearance of harmful algal blooms in the Arctic Ocean.

I am also passionate about increasing access to STEM and education through long-range mentorship. Head to the [Outreach & Mentoring](https://slim8288.github.io/mentoring) page to learn more!

I recently gave a talk for the International Glaciological Society's Global Seminar Series on some of my recent work creating 15+ year time series of ice algal habitat in both poles. You can watch the [video here](https://youtu.be/Z_-POxSpuCU).
