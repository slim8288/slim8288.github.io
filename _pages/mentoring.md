## Future Advancers of Science and Technology (FAST)

[FAST](https://fast.stanford.edu) is a program in which graduate students mentor high school students in brainstorming a novel and original STEM project, executing the project, and sharing the results with the larger community. I have been involved as a mentor since 2019. I have served as a primary mentor for 4 students, each over the course of 6 months, on projects ranging from bacterial growth on components of coffee to student opinions on policing. FAST serves historically disenfranchised or under-resourced schools, so our program goals include increasing feelings of ownership and belonging in STEM, providing long-range mentorship (that often continues for years beyond program completion), and supporting college application and attendence.

I was a leader of the Stanford student organization during 2020-2023. I served as Financial Officer and then as Development Officer. These roles included managing our budget and reimbursements, as well as seeking and applying to funding grants. I am most proud of our work establishing the [Grant Imahara FAST Scholarship](https://www.fastprogram.org/gifs) in partnership with a local nonprofit, the [Grant Imahara STEAM Foundation](https://www.grantimaharafoundation.org). This scholarship provides $10k over two years to FAST alumni in college! I co-lead a wonderful team in proposing, designing, and rolling out the scholarship. 

## Sustainability Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering (SURGE) Program
I have had the fortune of mentoring several undergraduate students, prior to and during my time at Stanford! Most recently I served as the primary research mentor for a student through the [SURGE](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/our-community/dei/surge) REU program in 2022.

## Other Previous
In college, I volunteered often at [Pomona Hope](https://www.pomonahope.org), which provides K-12 enrichment and holistic community programs to Pomona, California. I designed curriculum for, led workshops for, mentored, and tutored students of all grades (age 5-18) and ability levels in reading, writing, math, science, arts, gym, and garden activities. Previous outreach experience also includes [Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org) (being a science penpal), designing a booth for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution public science stroll, an elementary school workshop, and a talk at a retirement home.
