I am passionate about increasing recruitment and retention in STEM and higher education through mentorship and public outreach. I have specifically tried to invest my time and energy in longitudinal programs. 

## Future Advancers of Science and Technology (FAST)

[FAST](https://www.fastprogram.org) is a program in which graduate students mentor high school students in brainstorming a novel and original STEM project, executing the project, and sharing the results with the larger community. During 2019-2023, I served as a primary mentor for 4 students, each over the course of 6 months, on projects ranging from bacterial growth on components of coffee to student opinions on policing. FAST serves historically disenfranchised or under-resourced schools, so our program goals include increasing feelings of ownership and belonging in STEM, providing long-range mentorship (that often continues for years beyond program completion), and supporting college application and attendance.

I have held several leadership positions in FAST, but I am most proud of our work establishing the [Grant Imahara FAST Scholarship](https://www.fastprogram.org/gifs) in 2023, in partnership with a local nonprofit, the [Grant Imahara STEAM Foundation](https://www.grantimaharafoundation.org). The scholarship provides $10k over 2 years to FAST alumni in college! Over 8 months, I co-led a wonderful team team in proposing, designing, and rolling out the scholarship. The scholarship is now established as an ongoing annual award entering its third year. More than 75% of recipients are first-generation college students, and the scholarship has enabled some recipients to attend a four-year school instead of community college. I continue to co-lead the scholarship application and review process and to serve as a mentor resource for current recipients navigating their college experience.

> How you can be involved:
* FAST is looking to launch new college + high school partnerships and to increase support and resources for our student projects. Please see the [FAST website](https://www.fastprogram.org) or I can get you connected via email.
* If you are a graduate student at Stanford or UC Berkeley, you can be a FAST mentor! Please see the [Stanford FAST website](https://fast.stanford.edu) or email berkeleyFAST (at) gmail.com

## Sustainability Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering (SURGE) Program
I have had the fortune of mentoring several undergraduate students prior to and during my time at Stanford! Most recently I served as the primary research mentor for a student through the [SURGE](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/our-community/dei/surge) REU program in 2022.

## Public Talks
I am always open to giving talks in public or educational settings. Please get in touch if you are interested! Past audiences and venues include:
* Scripps College, public audience
* The Claremont Colleges, Oceanography class
* Rise University Preparatory (high school), Environmental Science class
* Retirement Home in Falmouth, MA

## Other Previous
* In college, I volunteered for 3 years at [Pomona Hope](https://www.pomonahope.org), which provides K-12 enrichment and holistic community programs to Pomona, California. I designed curriculum for, led workshops for, mentored, and tutored students of all grades (age 5-18) and ability levels in reading, writing, math, science, arts, gym, and garden activities
* Science penpal with a middle school student through [Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org)
* Designed and ran a booth for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution public science stroll
